# Restaurant App

## Setup:

This project uses `json-server` to host the Menu items on `localhost:3000`.

Hence, it is recommended to have `json-server` and must be running in background so that the app works.

You can install `json-server` by following these steps:-
1. Install `npm`
2. Run the following command : `npm install -g json-server` (use `sudo` prefix if you are using linux)
3. From the Project directory, run the following command : `json-server --watch menu-items.json`

You are good to go now.

## Running the Application

Since the project is a standalone html page. You don't need any server to run, since everything is handled by javascript.

* Just open `index.html` in browser and you are good to go.
